The data for this investigation is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data.


Through these three notebooks I investigate the same questions posed by the author of the data:

    Is it possible to determine if an inverter is faulty or malfunctioning?
    
    Is it possible to identify if there is dirty or damaged equipment?
    
    Can we predict the next several days of yield to allow for better grid management?
    
## solar_investigation:
    With this notebooks we tackle the first two questions.
    
## Station_1_prediction:
    Investigate how well the data collected from station 1 allows us to predict the last 4 days of observed data.
    
## Station_2_prediction:
    Investigates the accuracy of prediction for station 2 and answers questions regarding potential trends or patterns in the data.
